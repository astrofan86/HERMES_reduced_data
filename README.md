The final reduced 1-dimension spectra of all 877 targets of SDST. The combined spectrum of each target was stored as four FITS files (under CCD 1-4) corresponding to four HERMES bands (blue, green, red and infrared). Each FITS file includes the relative flux and the corresponding uncertainty array. Read the FITS header for more information.
