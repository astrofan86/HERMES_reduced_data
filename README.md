This repository contains the following folders:


– DRS_extracted_spectra:
FITS files produced by the ESPRESSO Data Reduction Software (DRS) containing the extracted, wavelength calibrated spectrum of both traces, of each echelle order, for each of the 17 quasar exposures.


– Final_spectrum:
FITS file of the final, combined spectrum (hes0515m44114.fits) produced by the command in the UVES_popler.command file using the hes0515m4414.upl UVES_popler Log (UPL) file and the atmospheric line mask in atmomask.dat.
